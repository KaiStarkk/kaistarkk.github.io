In the last post I documented our stay in Paris. It's a truly beautiful city, and we were sad to leave after only a couple nights when we left on our first Busabout leg bound for Amsterdam. Busabout is an interesting alternative to trains and flights in Europe. They market themselves as a "hop-on hop-off" choice, though the busses often fill up before the day of departure. The busses always leave at 8am, which can be a pain when you're a long way from the pick-up hostel, and they typically arrive around 5pm on the same day. There are service stops roughly every two hours. The service is a good one, although I think our choice to book the North, West, and South loops until October as opposed to paying for each leg of the trip may have been a mistake. Travel agents really should point these things out. Anyways.

Amsterdam is a great city, but only for two days. After that, the smell of weed (which is everywhere) starts to make you feel nauseated. Our hostel was pretty good, although they messed up our booking (we were compensated with drinks). 

Amsterdam was my first experience with survival of the fittest - I was almost killed by a tram ten minutes into the stop because they barely demarcate the dividing lines between footpath, road, and rail lines (the bitchumen slightly changes colour). Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to visit Anne Frank House [sic]. We also went on a pubcrawl but I don't remember a whole lot about that.

Finally: bikes. Bikes everywhere.

After the short stay, we shot across to Berlin. Plus Berlin is an AMAZING hostel, as long as you don't need to talk to anyone there. The rooms are huge, and there is a pool and sauna, however the laundry room is terrible. One of the machines ate a few coins, but we continued to put coins in because the first (majority) were accepted and we anticipated that the reception would be understanding and helpful. We just wanted to get our washing done before the sun came up (it was midnight at the time). Instead of refunding us and apologising for the inconvenience that was their broken laundry machine (they never put an out of order sign up afterwards, either), we were forced to argue for half an hour with a condescending "manager" before they finally gave the money back. Didn't exactly set a great tone.

Nothing could keep our spirits down for too long though. Berlin is an incredible city. We went on a bike tour that visited a number of Second World War and Cold War sites and monuments, ending with a drink in the Tiergarten. We also went on a walking tour that was specifically devoted to Third Reich Berlin. Both were amazing, and Berlin's history is fascinating. We also caught a glimpse of modern Berlin, which is a vibrant scene characterised by alternative art and music. There's too much to write about our stay in this city, so I'm keeping it short and instead suggesting that it must be visited to be understood.
