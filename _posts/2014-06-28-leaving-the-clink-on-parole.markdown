Wow, we've been busy.

After [my post on Wednesday]({% post_url 2014-06-25-planes-trains-and-baggage-claims %}) (and the highly anticipated shower), we further familiarised ourselves with the underground - particularly the Piccadily line. In London they use a contactless card system called Oyster similar to the SmartRider cards in Perth, different in that the card is actually distributed by the ticket machines instead of being bought at a vendor and associated with an account. There's clearly benefits and disadvantages to each system but we found it more convenient for the traveller, despite being significantly more expensive (justified Grace posited by the fact that nobody here spends a lot of money on petrol).

We got off at the Leicester (LESS-ter, glad I knew this beforehand or I may have drawn a lot of attention) station and started our sightseeing at the National Gallery, one of the places we were most eager to visit. It's a very large gallery with a broad collection that is all owned by the public. The [floorplan](http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/visiting/floorplans/level-2/) is divided into periods, each running a couple centuries from the 1250s onwards, and we spent most of our time in the Sainsbury wing, which held pieces from before the 16th century.

I was surprised to find that I didn't like the works of Boticelli that I saw there. The style coupled with the way the paint has faded made me feel unnerved in viewing them. My preferred artist of those we saw at the Gallery was Raphael. A lot of his pieces were oil/egg on poplar or wood which has remained bright and vivid in colour. If I could have seen the pieces in their time this may have been a different story, since I recognise that the state of degradation of the paintings affected how I felt about them. Some from the 13th century had lost almost all their colour to a desaturated brown. We also saw a cartoon by [Da Vinci](http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci-the-burlington-house-cartoon) that was kept in a dark room segregated from the rest. It wasn't completely finished, which gave some small insight into his preparation and process.

The gallery opens into Trafalgar Square, where we took a few photos before hurrying home to get ready for Matilda.

The show was absolutely phenomenal. I was continually surprised by the child actors who didn't miss a beat or a note for the entire show. The little girl playing Matilda was brilliant. The set and lights were amazing, though I think sound was too high. The man playing Ms Trunchibald was also exceedingly funny, and Miss Honey was exactly as I remember her from the book. The music has been stuck in my head since I first heard it; Tim Minchin did great work on it.

Yesterday, we discovered Barclay's Bikes. It's an initiative by Transport for London (TfL) that I was impressed with immediately. It's based on systems that have been quite successful in other parts of Europe; essentially you pay an access fee of 2 pounds, and for the whole day you can undock a bike from any of the scores of docking stations around the city and ride it to another. As long as the individual journeys are less than 30 minutes, that's all you pay. The fee for an additional half hour is only one pound, though it increases quickly. It's very easy to find a station to renew the loan however. I spoke with the most helpful customer service representative I've ever spoken with when I confirmed a few details - I wish we had a system like this in Perth. 

We rode these bikes from our hostel down to Shakespeare's Globe, where we payed a small entry fee to see the exhibition. Grace and I both love theatre, so it was enthralling to visit the site where contemporary theatre essentially began. Before the playhouses on bankside were built, bands of actors would typically perform in tavern yards and the like, but the big four on bankside are what tranformed English theatre into a massive industry through Shakespeare's time. Learning about Elizabethan cosmetics was painful. Crushed pearls and white lead were common foundations.

After the Globe we walked back up to the bike dock and rode to Westminster Abbey. Short on time, we didn't enter, but we did take photos infront of it and Big Ben before scrambling to renew our bike loans and ride to Buckingham Palace. I would have liked to be able to see the Crown Jewels and visit the Tower of London but, having only three days to see the whole city, we decided it was time to head back home via the Wellington Arch and Hyde Park. We quickly got ready and caught the train back to Leicester Station to see The Book of Mormon. This play is hilariously offensive. I love the book and lyrics, it is written by the creators of South Park, and reflects this association. The performance was phenomenal, though I wish I could have heard Josh Gad as Elder Cunningham - there's no replacing his voice.

Grace and I just checked out of our hostel, Clink78. We're sitting in that same TV courtroom now, preparing and planning for our stay in Paris. Our train leaves at 14:01 (one hour from now), and I'm using the intervening time to load 50 books that I love and want to read again, or have been meaning to read, onto my Kindle.
