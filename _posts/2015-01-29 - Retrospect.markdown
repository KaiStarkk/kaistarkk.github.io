2015 already.

A lot has passed since I last wrote on here. I left my travel blog teetering on the edge, about to embark on a journey through Italy, Spain and our final destination: Istanbul, Turkey. There were so many more stories than I could ever fit in a blog. Venice was as I'd expected - artificial. A city long voided of its inhabitants by a roaring tourism industry that swallowed the islands up faster than the ocean is. Rome was as enthralling as I remembered it to be. I was thrilled to visit my favourite ancient building - the Pantheon - and enjoyed the stay at the Yellow, which was another in a chain of vibrant hostels. The walking tours here were among the best of the entire trip.

The next stop was Florance - which was where I was physically when writing the previous posts. We had a great dearth of time here, and I felt like I wasn't able to truly appreciate the city. After a single night in beautiful Nice, we then travelled into Barcelona, Catalonia, where we learned a great deal about Spanish and Catalonian culture, and the divide in the country. I had the best calamari of my life, and the best mojito of my life there, and ended up having private snorkelling and kayaking lessons for two at only a sixth the price (the four other people cancelled). We went on a Spanish "cooking experience" where we didn't really cook anything. I was also electrocuted across the chest by a shoddy magnetic door lock and the manager didn't seem to care. Our snorkelling instructor chatted with us for a couple hours about the terrible corruption problem in Spain.

Finally we flew across to Istanbul. We ate at our hostel every day and loved it. After 6 weeks of travelling we were exhausted, and didn't see a great deal of the city, but we did partake in the relaxed Turkish culture. So many places to visit again one day soon.

Now I'm back in Perth. I suppose I should phrase that in the past tense - it's been almost half a year since this trip, though I still look back on it fondly. The intervening months have been less rousing - I'm now working full to almost full time while waiting for the university semester to finally come around.

This year is my first year of my masters degree. I'm studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering specialising in Process Instrumentation and Control and Microelectronics, with focus in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

I couldn't be more excited to start work on that Iron Man suit.
