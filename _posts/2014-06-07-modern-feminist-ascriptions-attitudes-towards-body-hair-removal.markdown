The aesthetic practice of shaving the legs and under the arms is undoubtedly a time consuming one. Very little research has been done to analyze the origins of this social norm - a norm which has recently become the topic of a frustrated debate. A contemporary notion amongst some members of the feminist community is that it is a male issue: primarily, that it originates from arbitrary or perverted male preferences, and secondarily, that it is perpetuated solely or predominantly by male expectations. A common argument is one by emotion, likening hairlessness preference to child sexualisation. What research has been done contradicts these ideas.

To address the secondary concern first, the perpetuation of the norm today is due in greater part to female preferences than male ones, and social pressures are created by male and female attitudes equally. The majority of adult women who remove body hair do so due to intrinsic reward, rather than societal pressures (Basow, Tiggemann), associating it positively with femininity, and whilst women are more likely to identify with feminist ideologies than men, attitudes and discrimination towards women who do not conform - that is to say the fair attribution of the social pressures - is not differentiated by gender (Basow & Braman).

Sexual preference of these youthful qualities has its root in evolutionary pressures rather than arbitrary social ones. Human denudation itself was likely a response to ectoparisitic threat (Rantala); and similarly neoteny, which is present in a number of animal species far less social or arbitrary than humans, is both evolutionarily and sexually selected due to the accompaniment of faster onset sexual development in paedomorphic orgamisms (Ridley), and the greater biological viability of young mothers.
