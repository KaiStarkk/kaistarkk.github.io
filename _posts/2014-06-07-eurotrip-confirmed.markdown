To the seismologists reading this, sorry - that was my bank account balance.

In seriousness, Grace and I just booked the latter half of our trip to Europe and I haven't been this excited since the time that I forgot that I was watching Game of Thrones and momentarily lapsed into believing that Oberyn Martell was going to win.

I present an itinerary virtually bursting with slapstick racism:

We're leaving on the 24th of June, bound for London via Kuala Lumpur. Tickets to *The Book of Mormon* and *Matilda* are booked, and we're staying at [Clink78](http://www.clinkhostels.com/london/backpacker-hostels/clink78). It's going to be a good one. Hold on to your teeth.

Then we're getting into a metal cylinder to be propelled through a conduit that a bunch of blokes in high-vis jackets have cut through an ocean. This is why I'm studying to be an engineer. Hopefully resurfacing somewhere in France, we'll make our way over to Paris to look at beautiful paintings and glass buildings and towers and then we'll eat some snails.

After a few days in the city of love, we're scooting off to Amsterdam for a 420 blaze-it-up red light district culture shock (I kid), where we're staying at [The Flying Pig](http://www.flyingpig.nl/), which our travel advisor almost had a seizure telling us about. I'm expecting everyone to be albino blond, and continuously riding antiseptic-white bicycles between their favourite hipster coffee shops (at each of which I should see at least one casual businessman toking from an arm-long blunt). Don't disappoint me "The Netherlands". (I kid).

Next is Berlin where I would meet up with my hacker friends if I had any from Germany (how did that happen?). I really look forward to drinking beer from a glass that I would be able to fit my head into if it were only normal-sized. \<Error 404: Hitler joke not found\>. Staying at [Plus Berlin](http://www.plushostels.com/plusberlin).

*Aside: The paragraphs will continue to shrink as it slowly dawns on me that I should be studying for [exams]({% post_url 2014-06-06-procrastination-posts-incoming %}).*

After Berlin is Prague, where there'll be beautiful architecture.

Vienna.

Mother Italy:

1. Venice - canal city a.k.a. Perth + 20 years. Shakespeare etc.
2. Roma - Too much to name here.
3. Vatican City - highest popes per capita in the world.
4. Probably venture south to my Nanna's home town of Gaeta which is basically the cradle of Roman civilisation.
5. Possibly visit Pompeii (not so fussed about this since it is becoming more and more a modern facade as the ruins degrade).
6. Firenze - #Shopping for Grace. Shakespeare etc.

Then to Nice, which is the city in France that people my age only know for its appearance in a Grand Theft Auto game.

Penultimately Barcelona for a week.

Finally Istanbul for a few days before we fly back home, to arrive on August the 3rd just in time to have missed the first week of uni.
