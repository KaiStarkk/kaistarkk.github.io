Examination season is upon us. Consequently you can expect to see a number of posts that are in no way related to my course content being posted here over the next few weeks.

For those interested, the impending exams that I'm enrolled in are the following:

1. CITS3001 - Algorithms and Artificial Intelligent
2. ENSC3014 - Electronic Materials and Devices
3. ENSC3017 - Circuits and Electronics
4. CITS3002 - Networks and Security

Which are to take place on the 11th, 14th, 16th and 17th of this month respectively. 

I've taken the time to reflect on how I feel about this, and have concluded after appropriate deliberation that pen and paper exams for computer science are completely, dirt-in-their-hair bonkers, and that electrical engineering is hard.

Stay tuned for what will invariably be an armada of posts about philosophy or social issues (which I will never ever ever get any course credit for), intermixed with frantic attempts at solutions to practice questions and exams that I'm underprepared for.
