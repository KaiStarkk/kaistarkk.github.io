Firenze? Yes, I'm writing this from Florence. I also have to admit, I wrote that last post here as well despite it's name. Busy busy busy.

It was hard to leave Berlin, as it was easily my favourite city up to that point. London is wonderful, and Paris is beautiful but Berlin is immense. It's a veritable giant when it comes to modern history, and history is one of my strongest passions. Nevertheless, we had to part.

Much as I made it to Prague before I wrote about the preceding three stops, I've since visited: Prague, Vienna, Munich, Venice, and Rome. Also, I never could remember that miracle conconction I'd been rambling about. It was probably a vew Mojito's followed by a double espresso, so don't get too excited. Also as a side-note, I'd finished reading Wuthering Heights by the time I made it to Prague (I can see why it kicked up the contemporary fuss that it did, but this is a travel post not a literature one) and started on Metamorphosis by Kafka (an author who was born and is buried in Prague, and one who I'd been interested in for a long time).

Prague is a very interesting city to me, primarily because of the numerous striking juxtapositions that are a part of life there. Walking through the streets, I saw modernist architecture - particularly cubism, which Prague is famous for having practically invented - taking the fore. Almost every building looks the same in some streets, differentiated only by paint colours. This is in stark contrast to the interiors. I'd anticipated something quaint, and moderately antique when we walked into the hostel, but was met by hypermodern interior design. Everything from neon-lights for room numbers (the corridors resembled a laser-tag centre), to wide-flat chrome showerheads and wall projections on the marble staircases made an appearance. I finished Metamorphosis around the middle of the trip, and it took me some time to appreciate why Nabokov (an author and literary critic famous for his genius, arrogance, and disdain for many other authors typically understood to also be geniuses) places it in his top five of the twentieth century.

Unfortunately, Grace fell quite sick in Prague. We spent the day in a hospital after a ride in an ambulance, despite the fact that we'd only asked the reception if there were any doctors nearby. Thankfully, she felt much better very quickly after some IV fluids and nutrients, as she hadn't eaten or drunk anything in around 30 hours. Because of this illness, I can't comment on some of the sights like Prague Castle or the astronomical clock, or the Jewish cemetary, but I can say that Prague is a beautiful (and fairly cheap) city, that I'll look forward to visiting in the future and recommend visiting to anyone travelling in the region.
