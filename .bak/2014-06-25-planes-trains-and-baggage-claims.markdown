Perth to KL isn't too arduous a flight. I was able to watch the [*LEGO Movie*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/), which was AMAZING. Also saw [*The Grand Budapest Hotel*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/) which is a wonderfully eccentric film with a great cast. I recommend both.

The longer trip from KL to London Heathrow was around 13 hours in duration. 
Economy class is definitely economical. It's really hard to call the state of a free market stupid, but I still want to. Anyway, by the blessings of the nine divines the seat next to Grace and I was empty, so we were able to take turns lying down. Can't complain. I watched [*Mr Peabody and Sherman*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864835/) on this flight, which was also nice. Not sure why I kept picking the kids movies.

On arrival we proudly navigated the Underground (or "The Tube" as the natives less than affectionately call it) without issue. Cue cute part of the story, each of us found a penny at Kings Cross station and picked it up for good luck (I subsequently had the epiphany that 'pence' is plural for 'penny' and not some portmanteau of 'pound' and 'cents' as I'd previously thought. I need a sleep.)

After a short walk (via McDonalds) we found ourselves at our hostel, [Clink78](http://www.clinkhostels.com/london/backpacker-hostels/clink78/) which by the looks of things, knows its demographic VERY well. I'm writing this on a 'W' couch which is one of a long row that covers the floor of a courtroom. The entire hostel purports to be full of equally quirky and interesting rooms. It was converted from a jail (thus its name) and now sports on its walls a vibrant colour palette and numerous motivational quotes in schizophrenic typography. I can see us making a lot of friends in this place, it appears to be very popular and I'm already very fond of it.

You can find the hostel's photo gallery [here](http://www.clinkhostels.com/london/backpacker-hostels/clink78/photos).

In the remainder of the day, we'll hopefully get a bit more familiar with the city before checking in and meeting the other 14 people sharing our dorm. Tonight, we have tickets to see Matilda the musical (written by Tim Minchin) which I'm sure will be great. The most exciting item on the horizon however, is the prospect of having a god damned shower.


What's up with airplane food?
(Sorry I had to).
